// Create a program that manages a list of employees in a company.
// Define a data class called Employee with properties: id, name, department, and salary.
// Implement a function that filters employees based on their department.
// Implement a function that calculates the average salary of employees in a given department.
// Use nullable types where appropriate.
// Use functional programming concepts (e.g., higher-order functions, lambda expressions).

// Your code goes here.

fun main() {
    // Create a list of employees, filter and print employees in a specific department,
    // and calculate the average salary in that department.
